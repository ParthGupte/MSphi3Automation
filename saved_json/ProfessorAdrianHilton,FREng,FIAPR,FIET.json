    "university": "University of Surrey",
    "department": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)",
    "research": "My research is pioneering the next generation of 4D computer vision, capable of sensing both 3D shape and motion, to enable seeing machines that can understand and model dynamic scenes. For example, measuring from video the biomechanics of an Olympic athlete performing a world-record high-jump. I have successfully commercialised technologies for 3D and 4D shape capture exploited in entertainment, manufacture & health, receiving two EU IST Innovation Prizes, a Manufacturing Industry Achievement Award, and a Royal Society RS Industry Fellowship with Framestore on Digital Doubles for Film (2008-11). I am a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award holder in 4D Vision (2013-18) and is currently PI on the S3A Programme Grant in Future Spatial Audio at Home combining audio and vision expertise and InnovateUK project ALIVE, led by The Foundry, developing tools for 360 video reconstruction and editing.",
    "prospective_students": "Please contact me if you are interested in current PhD and post-doctoral research opportunities.",
