    "research": "My research lies at the intersection of generative AI and multi-modal learning, with a strong emphasis on their computational efficiency. Our mission is to build intelligent systems that robustly understand, generate, and interact with physical worlds. We hope to achieve this with minimum cost, by tapping and repurposing the rich capabilities of large foundation models through modular, compositional, and post-training techniques.",
    "prospective_students": "I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students, postdocs, and research assistants for Spring/Fall 2026. For more details, please see Opening. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out via email at x3yang@outlook.com with your resume.",
