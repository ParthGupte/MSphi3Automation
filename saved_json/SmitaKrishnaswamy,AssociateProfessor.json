    "university": "Yale University",
    "department": "Computer Science (SEAS) and Genetics (YSM)",
    "research": "Smita Krishnaswamy's lab focuses on the intersection of computer science, applied math, computational biology, and signal processing to develop representation-learning and deep learning methods for exploratory analysis, scientific inference, and prediction from big biomedical datasets. Her methods incorporate mathematical priors from graph spectral theory, manifold learning, signal processing, and topology into machine learning and deep learning frameworks for denoising, modeling, visualization, generative modeling, dynamics modeling, comparative analysis, and domain transfer.",
    "prospective_students": "Prospective students are encouraged to reach out to Smita Krishnaswamy via her office email for guidance on research opportunities and academic advice.",
