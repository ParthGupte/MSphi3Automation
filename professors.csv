"Andreas Vlachos, Professor of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning",andreas.vlachos@cam.ac.uk,University of Cambridge,Department of Computer Science and Technology,"Current projects include dialogue modelling, automated fact-checking and imitation learning. I have also worked on semantic parsing, natural language generation and summarization, language modelling, information extraction, active learning, clustering and biomedical text mining.","Prior to this I was a lecturer at the University of Sheffield, working on the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.",https://andreasvlachos.github.io//
"David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Assistant Professor",email address not provided,"McGill School of Computer Science, Canada",Computer Science,"My research focuses on multilingual NLP and Speech processing especially for low-resource languages. My PhD focused on NLP for African languages but now I am expanding to various regions of the world including South Asia, South-East Asia and Americas indigeneous languages.","Previously, I was a DeepMind Academic Fellow at UCL, and I obtained a PhD in Computer Science at Saarland University. I will be recruiting MSc/PhD students for fall 2025, if you are interested, please apply through MILA’s request for supervision (deadline December 1, 2024).",https://dadelani.github.io/
Jackie Cheung,kchehbouni@gmail.com,McGill University,School of Computer Science,"My group investigates natural language processing, an area of AI research that builds computational models of human languages, such as English or French. The goal of our research is to develop computational methods for understanding text and speech in order to generate language that is fluent and context appropriate. In our lab, we investigate statistical machine learning techniques for analyzing and making predictions about language. Some of my current projects focus on summarizing fiction, extracting events from text, and adapting language across genres.",Collaborating Alumni - McGill University Website Github Google Scholar,https://mila.quebec/en/directory/jackie-cheung
"Laurent Charlin, Interim Scientific Director of Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and Associate Professor at HEC Montréal",laurent.charlin@mila.quebec,Université de Montréal,Not specified,"Charlin’s research focuses on developing novel machine learning models to aid in decision-making. Recent work has focused on learning from data that changes over time, and on applications in fields such as recommender systems and optimization. He has a number of highly cited publications on dialogue systems (chatbots).",Not specified,https://mila.quebec/en/directory/laurent-charlin
"Professor Adrian Hilton, FREng, FIAPR, FIET",a.hilton@surrey.ac.uk,University of Surrey,"Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)","My research is pioneering the next generation of 4D computer vision, capable of sensing both 3D shape and motion, to enable seeing machines that can understand and model dynamic scenes. For example, measuring from video the biomechanics of an Olympic athlete performing a world-record high-jump. I have successfully commercialised technologies for 3D and 4D shape capture exploited in entertainment, manufacture & health, receiving two EU IST Innovation Prizes, a Manufacturing Industry Achievement Award, and a Royal Society RS Industry Fellowship with Framestore on Digital Doubles for Film (2008-11). I am a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award holder in 4D Vision (2013-18) and is currently PI on the S3A Programme Grant in Future Spatial Audio at Home combining audio and vision expertise and InnovateUK project ALIVE, led by The Foundry, developing tools for 360 video reconstruction and editing.",Please contact me if you are interested in current PhD and post-doctoral research opportunities.,https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/adrian-hilton
